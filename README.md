# Simple neural network in javascript

Translation to javascript of the article
https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-68998a08e4f6
without using libraries.

I implemented in javascript basic matrix operations.

To train and run the network:

```shell
node neural-network.js
```

update May 2023:
implementing in pure C without dependencies in a single file.

To compile the file and run the example just type:
```shell
make
```
